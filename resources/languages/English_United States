Compatible Models
The model may not support Live2D Cubism 2.0 Core. If it is 2.0 Core, it may require modeling with a 64-bit application. 32-bit applications are not supported.
Your model does not support Live2D Cubism 2.0 Core. The program has a built-in 2.0 Core model. Would you like to enable it?
Restarting the program is required to enable the compatible model.

Recognition Sampling
Pure AVGï¼ˆsum(s) / len(s)ï¼‰
AVG Min+ï¼ˆsum(s) / len(s) + min(s)ï¼‰
AVG Max+ï¼ˆsum(s) / len(s) + max(s)ï¼‰
Double AVGï¼ˆsum(s) / len(s) * 2ï¼‰
Sampling needs to be done in a quiet environment, and it will record the environment and calculate the volume. The sampling data will be calculated based on the algorithm (Algorithm).
Compatible architecture
Your model architecture is not compatible with the current architecture. You need to restart the program to reload the architecture!
It's different from the architecture version and the engine version. If you load it multiple times, it may cause the shader to crash.
