Recognition Sampling
Pure AVG（sum(s) / len(s)）
AVG Min+（sum(s) / len(s) + min(s)）
AVG Max+（sum(s) / len(s) + max(s)）
Double AVG（sum(s) / len(s) * 2）
Sampling needs to be done in a quiet environment, and it will record the environment and calculate the volume. The sampling data will be calculated based on the algorithm (Algorithm).
Compatible architecture
Your model architecture is not compatible with the current architecture. You need to restart the program to reload the architecture!
It's different from the architecture version and the engine version. If you load it multiple times, it may cause the shader to crash.
